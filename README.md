### Description
Daily hour and money tracking aplication. I made this aplication mainly for me and students (because of the flexible work hours).


### How to use
- Pick the date
- Choose if you have day/night hours or normal day hours (checkbox)
- Select hours worked and â‚¬/h
- Add to database
- Later choose month and year to get your monthly salary


### Notes
- I made this aplication in my free time, I know the code is badly written
- The app is not properly tested
- In the future I will translate to english
- Date_picker code is not mine
- Gui.py is main file
